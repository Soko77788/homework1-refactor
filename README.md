# homework1-refactor

## Refactoring a given set of code.

Goals and Outcomes of the project include: 
1. Changing Semantic HTML
2. Changing and Optimizing CSS
3. Adding Accessibility to the page and images
4. Retaining the look of the website after optimization

After overcoming these issues client will be left with a cleaner set of code to alter in the future if the website needs updates. The flow of the content will be much easier to understand. 

Throughout this project I learned alot about semantic html and grouping css sytles together using only a fraction of the selectors.
